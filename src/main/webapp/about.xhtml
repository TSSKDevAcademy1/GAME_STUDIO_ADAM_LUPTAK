			<p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
				denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a
				complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
				the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
				happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
				because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
				pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
				painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires
				to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
				occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure
				him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
				undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
				advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
				who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,
				or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
